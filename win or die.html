    <p id="marquee"><marquee> All of my blogs are subjective ,especially this one .</marquee></p>
    <p>If you are in depths of depression , like me then there must problem in both physical  and mental worlds .</p>
    <p>lets just say this is loosing . so what's winnig bro [nobody knows] .(watchout some guru's will try to convince you otherwise) </p>
    <p>let's try to explore what win could be [Recall : highly subjective]</p>
    <p>At the end of the day : humans are RL agents , and they are trying to maximize some reward function. again [not maximizing a reward function is also a reward function] </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Because nobody starts with the same set of desires ,<b> Even understanding : what is win , is going to be an iterative process .</b> </p>
    <p>Maybe that's why majority of Western world is better off then asians coz they start their desire above survival , and we start or mostly remains at survival .</p>
    <p>But to nature its does not matter , how much poor that person was who figured new science , the fact he did only matters .</p>
    <hr>
    <p><u>Truth about  this iterative process </u></p>
    <p>[only way to win] : Be truthfull to yourself</p>
    <p>[only way to loose] : spend a life lived in delusions</p>
    <p>If you follow the above process .it does not matter if you started with money[Trust me bro money is not the thing],still you will iterate over your changing desires and you will reach there .</p>
    <h3><b>[UNLESS] : you spend your life in delusions</b></h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Hack our way to destination : this above is an iterative proces : really lengthy .</p>
    <p>For me the these 2 are winners :</p>
    <p><b>[some winners]</b></p>
    <img src="images/elon.png" alt="elon" height="20%" width="20%">
    <img src="images/george.png" alt="george" height="16.6%" width="16.6%">
    <p>i like less flashy so for me george is a bigger role model .</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>[Some loosers] : [ politicians ][ influencers ][ advertiser ]</b></p>
  
    <hr>
    <p>Lets ignore the loosers and see what makes these winners [ a winner]</p>
    <p>1.They actually and deeply know the shit they are talking about .</p> 
    <p>2.They don't think only one or two layers deep , they understand and think through entire stack from phyics to cs . They truely know what is at the core of a thing . </p>
    <p>3.They have very good mental models to understand things  like : </p>
    <p> 3.1 by comparing : what's closest thing available to compare from .</p>
    <p> 3.2  first principles : break things down to fundamentals and build up from there </p>
    <p> 3.3 change the size and scope of things and see how this will affect the system </p>   
    <p> 3.4 exploring connection : everytime trying to store a new piece of information think first (how/and in how many ways) this new relates to what i already know .</p>
    <p> 3.5 looking at things from all the angles , to get a better picture of what the thing really is .</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>there is no shortage of framework see what suits you . Elons framework is also very good <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/spc5yf/what_do_you_think_of_elons_algorithm_for/" target="_blank">Elon's Engineering ALgorithm</a></p>
    <p>Or build your own algo </p>

    <p>The point is ...</p>
    <p><b>There is a deadline of plasiticity in brain and in human potential .if you crossed that age its, you can dance with your money but now you brain is limited and shitty ... </b></p>
    <p>it's most likely that i have crossed the deadline , but just for a last ditch attempt , i am going to ignore this .</p>

    <p><b>How to loose [Start Fast] : </b>set some crazy goals for the weekend and fail . [Repeat this in loop]</p>

    <ol>2.What [new actions] can reverse this problem , how much time will it take .<b>[make that new action a process : do daily]</b></ol>
    <ol>3.What old habbits will stop me from doing [new actions] , how will i deal with them .</ol>
    <ol>4.what are the test cases , to prove that i am winning .{this is tricky : making a good product vs no of users}</ol>

    <p><b>you can't go to v2 without going to v1</b>, the only reason iPhone 14 is so good is because it has gone through 14 version updates.</p>
    <br>
    <p><p>Don't think elon, george as they look , think of them as [ elon version 1000 ] , and [ george version 1000 ]</p></p>
    <p><b>What ever you want to become think interms of versions , and put a really good test-case to see if you have really become that version .</b> </p>
