    <p>[ Elon ] : EDUCATION = Downloading Data and Algorithms into Brain .</p>
    <p>Its TRUE , but because brain is not as good as hard disk and there is enormous data loss , lets edit the above definition .</p>
    <p><b> EDUCATION = [ DOWNLOADING ] and [ STORING ] Data and Algorithms into Brain .</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>So for learning : there is two different task <b>DOWNLOADING (i.e LEARNING)</b> AND <b>STORING</b></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Lets Understand this shit visually , because most of us are struggling with this ....</p>
    <p>Because i also don't know much about this so lets start with what works and not works. </p>

    <h3>Quantity of Information at a time .</h3>
    <p id="red">Lectures / Youtube : Like a flood of Information : learner is not learning anything just trying to survive .<b>[Too much water to digest]</b></p>
    <img src="/images/swim.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">
    <p id="green"> Self Study / Exploration : It should be like drinks , drinking and thinking ,[ THAT'S LEARNING ]  <b>[Sufficent to digest and enjoy]</b></p>
    <img src="/images/shorts.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">

    <h3>How to Approach learning : Learning by doing / Problem solving  . [NOT OCEAN DRINKING] </h3>
    <p id="red">First learn everything about all types of tools .<b>[you will be forgetting while learning] [you are lost and confused ] </b></p>
    <img src="/images/toolbox.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">
    <p id="green"> Pick a problem / Task : try to solve it , and learn the concepts that you encounter while solving that problem .<b> [The use/capability of that tool will become apparent ]</b></p>

    <h3>How to Store Information [MAKE IT RELEVENT] AND [CONNECTED IT TO A DEEPER CONCEPT/STORY] </h3>
    <p id="red">Isolated dots</p>
    <p id="red">collect unreleated pieces of information in your head .<b>[forget it after some time] [this is time waste not learning even it you were sitting for hours] </b></p>
    <img src="/images/random.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="10%">
    <p id="green"> While gathering new information ,ask (why it is relevent , how it is related to what i already know) etc  .<b> [There is learning only if the information is retained in your head for long term , and you can apply that to anything anytime]</b></p>
    <p id="green">Connected dots</p>
    <img src="/images/story.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">

    <h3>Measure Efforts not progress/current situation [When you are struggling and not making progress, that is exactly when you are making progress in reality] </h3>
    <p id="red"><b>Don't avoid efforts in thinking , the less you think ,the less capable in thinking you'll become</b></p>
    <p >Below Normal Brain :<b> Without Critical thinking </b></p>
    <img src="/images/sleep.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">
    <p id="green"> Put extra efforts in thinking about thinks in new and deep ways , the more you think ,the more capable in thinking you'll become</b></p>
    <p id="green"> Whenever you hear new piece of information ,think why it is relevent .</p>
    <p>Below Elon's Brain : <b>With Critical thinking </b></p>

    <h3>Find ways  to make learning process as fun as possible , else by default it will look like work .[ your brain will try to run away from it ]</h3>
    <p id="red">Work : grind : brain will find excuse to run away<b></p>
    <img src="/images/work.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="15%">
    <p id="green">Fun : games : brain will willingly come<b></p>

    <p> The reason no one can teach anyone  methods of learning , coz its not same for everyone and other don't know you brain </p>
    <p>Use these DO's and DON'T's to Develop and evolve learning Methods .</p>
