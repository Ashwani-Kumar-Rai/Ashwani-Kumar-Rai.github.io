<h1>Litmus test for self spamming and shit talking</h1>
<p>the best way to not end confusion or not reach to a goal is to take a sidestep . In life generally self spamming and shit talking are great sidesteps .</p>
<p>let's first define these two terms then we will talk about cure . </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Self Spamming are : </b></h3>
<p>--> Is asking questions to people , that you know don't have any answer , or they pretending to have an answer.(be carefull there are a lot of sales guys in every field , and thier job is to convince you ,"that they know the shit they are talking about") .</p>
<p>--> your question does not matter .  eg: who will win this election </p>
<p>--> you are asking question ,that is not possible for any human to answer .</p>
<p>--> you don't know what exactly you are asking . "you don't have a definition for the keywords that you are using " </p>
<br>
<h3><b>Shit talking are :</b> </h3>
<p>-->Whatever you are saying is meaningless .</p>
<p>--> prentending you know about something</p>
<p>--> if there is a good topic going on  , and  someone said something to derail the conversation .</p>
<br>
<p><u><p>In the above situations it does not matter where you get the answer from the other person or not .. you lost while asking the question .</p>
</u></p>
<hr>
<p><b>CURE :</b></p>
<p>You shoukd have some idea about the output space of the answer . </p>
<p>think about it whenever you go to a shop and you pay money , you have some idea what you are about to get . </p>
<p>In self spamming and shit talking , you are paying in time and getting nothing . i am not saying don't enjoy and make jokes . </p>
<p><b>But when you are asking a serious question ,you should have some idea of the output space to validate ,what you just bought with your time.</b></p>
