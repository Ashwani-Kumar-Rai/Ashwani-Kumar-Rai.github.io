        <h2>CURE : IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL FOR YEARS/DECADES .</h2>
        <img src="/images/sad.jpeg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="20%">   
        <p>Lets say that if you were destroying yourself for years , and you are not accepting this fact .<b> [THEN YOU ARE DOOMED] </b></p>
        <p><b> ACCEPT THE ABOVE FACT : [IF DONE , nothing changed ,except 1 possibility slightly changed among billions of possibilities]</b></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 0. Now think about what is TRUE {ABOUT : what is your current situaltion , what exactly you want }. Don't be wrong here , else later you will fall in a deeper hell .</p>
        <img src="/images/matrix.jpg" alt="Your Image" height="10%" width="10%">   
        <p>STEP 1. IMAGINE YOUR CURRENT REALITY AS A SYSTEM . A complicated Jumble of wires attached to your brain .</p>
        <p>STEP 2. Don't try to untangle those wire , you will fail as you have failed till now . </p>
        <p>STEP 3. As per STEP 0 ,figure our wires to consider and ignore .<b>[NOTE : by ignore i mean they are fucking dead , don't think about them ,its a cancer] </b></p>
        <p><b>[A Real Progress]</b> Now you have few wires to worry about , still whatever you want is out of reach</b></p>
        <p>STEP 4. Think whatever you want in terms of Physics , equations , what values these variables need to have so that you get your desired output.</p>
        <p>STEP 5. Don't make plans [ plan's fail ] , plan systems that will put you in positive feedback loop in the direction towards your desired variable's value .</p>
        <p>STEP 6. SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE LENSE OF THAT PHYSICS EQUATION , TRY NEW APPROACHES THAT YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED , AND OBSERVE CHANGES IN EQUATION . UNDERSTAND THAT EQUATIONS AS YOUR SECOND NATURE .</p>
        <p>STEP 7. you will notice few variable's value is moving in you favour , and few variables are not changing at all . see if you can delete these variables . else again make equations for them .</p>
        <p><b>[A Real Progress]</b> Now you are in a upward spiral . From here on you can accelerate your efforts to reach to your goal .</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>NOTE : </b> STEP 0 : is the most important step , whatever you decide here should be structurally better , and should be true for long term .</p>
