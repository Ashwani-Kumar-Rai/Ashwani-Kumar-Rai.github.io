    <h3>Imagine those times of excruciating pain , when you feel like  its better to die then live another second .</h3>
    <p><b>Ask yourself whether you are gonna do it or not (first be clear here) . if yes : _______ ,if no : continue reading</b></p>
    <p>To make sure we are on the same page and not shit talking , let me give you a situation .</p>
    
    <hr>
    <p>[Situation]</p>
    <p>you are a kid , you don't know much about the world , you go to school [ while hating it ] .</p>
    <p>you get bullied because you are not socially skilled enough .</p>
    <p>During school , at every second you wait for the bells to ring so that you can go home just to avoid this pain .</p>
    <p>you don't want to be alone , but you have became an alone person , because to avoid bully .</p>
    <hr>
    [Similar Situation]
    <p><u>you can get above situation in job also .</u></p>
    <p>People say that " job is modern day  slavery " . [I disagree with them because this comparision is not accurate]</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lets try to find a more accurate comparision</p> 
    <p>A slave : have no rights , no money , no freedom , zero rainy day fund</p>   
    <p>An Employee : have some rights , some money , some freedom , some to a lot of rainy day fund</p>
    <p>Still employee chooses to act like a slave [JUST TO MAINTAIN A LIFESTYLE] </p>
    <p>[ REVISION ] [JOB] ~= pros*******n </p>
    <hr>
    [RECALL] : you selected NO above ,so lets continue ,because either we have to find a solution or live in excruciating pain ]

    <p>THINK OF A TIME BOMB : As a timeline , till which you can manage to live with current situations .</p>
    <p>MEANING OF TIME BOMB EXPLODING (you decide for yourself): some examples [your death , till you loose all hope and skills , till you loose some of features of your brain , loosing someone close] </p>
    <p>Now you have 2 options :</p>

    <p>CRY : 1. why society is so cruel , why terrorists planted this bomb , don't they have a mother , sister , brother . Don't they have little humanity left in them . </p>
    <p>CRY : 2. listen listen , you know society would have been so much better if there were no terrorist. </p>
    <p>CRY : 3. Its the Duty of Defence forces and Government to deal with them , why should i suffer because of them .</p>
    <p>CRY : 4. I am a good person , i did nothing wrong . what should i do now...</p>
    <p>CRY : 5. [DAILY] Gather 10 friends and cry infront of them to gather some [advice/sympathy/humour] , and put these shit into your mind's database .</p>
    <p>ETC ...</p>
    <br>
    <h2>BUT LIKE , you did these 5 cry and Notice .......... </h2>
    <h2>[THE BOMB IS STILL TICKING]. AT CERTAIN TIME IT WILL EXPLODE .</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Fear  hesitation </b>: Sometime we feel that talking to someone will clearify things and we avoid talking in that situation [its fear]</p>
    <p>Remind yourself of time bomb philosophy. what actually matters ...</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>SOLUTION :<u>Figure out which of my actions will actually affect the bomb and do that .</u></h2>
    <p>i.e Crusade against stupidity !!! </p>
