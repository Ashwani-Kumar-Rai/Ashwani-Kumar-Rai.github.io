    <p><b>We are blessed by our intelligence , especially able to find patterns</b></p>
    <p><b>[Natural selection favors intelligence ,knowledge]</b> Who can tell the difference between usefull and harfull plants ,animals ,had better chance of survival and reproduction .</p>
    <p>For hunter gatheerers sky was the calender , changes in sky reflected changes on earth's whether</p>
    <p>All the civilizations thought comet as bringers of distruction ,only difference was the way that distruction will come .</p>
    <p><u>Human ability to find patter is two edged sword : we also find patterns when they are not really present</u></p>

    <p><b>OORT CLOUD</b> is a spherical layer of icy objects surrounding our Sun at a distance of 1 light year .</p>
    <p>The Oort cloud was named after Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort, who discovered it in the 1950s. He was looking to understand why some comets in the solar system have elongated orbits. Scientists now believe the Oort Cloud is the source of most such comets.</p>

    <p>Most part of comet is ice , so the number of times they come close to sun ,some of their parts became steam , 1000s of time happening this and ice is completely finishes .then comets gets converted to asteroid.Due to gravity sometimes they gets thrown out of solar system , they move around in space ,still somehow they comes back </p>
    <p><b>Comet :</b>also orbits the Sun, but unlike an asteroid, it's composed of ice and dust</p>
    <p><b>asteroid :</b>is a minor planet—an object that is neither a planet nor a comet—that orbits within the inner Solar System. They are rocky, metallic or icy bodies with no atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Note : If a commet is passing by near to 10 planets , then its path will get affected by the gravity of all 10 planets .</p>

    <p>before netwon ,Johannes Kepler[1571-1630] ,proved that sun is at the center and planets move in the ovel path , also planets near sun moves at a much faster speed then the planets that are far away.</p>

    <p>Everything Everything in our solar system goes around sun ,gravity attracts everything around sun ,but they also move in their path ,thus they don't fall into the sun</p>

    <p>Because of newton's laws of gravitation ,we can predict that milky way galaxy and andromida galaxy will mix together</p>
