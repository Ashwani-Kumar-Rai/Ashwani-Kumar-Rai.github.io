    <h3><b>We live on one level of reality ,but there are many levels of reality. At the core we are made up of atoms </b></h3>
    <p>crores crores cores of atoms combine at named as a human </p>
    <p>Atoms do a lot of fun things ,let see atoms of water</p>
    <p>[LIQUID] If the molecule is not too hot or cold then ,they can flow around each other ,there is some force between these molecules but not enough that it can give a solid shape</p>
    <img src="images/127.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">

    <p>[GAS] sun light heats up water ,due to increased energy ,molecules starts vibrating and the bond breaks , then they form vapours </p>
    <img src="images/128.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/129.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>The air we breathe contains the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen ,vapours , carbon dioxide </p>
    <p>Some molecules are falling down : meaning vapour is cooling  </p>
    <hr>
    <p>There is a cosmos inside the water vapour </p>
    <p>peramissia : lives inside water molecule , peramissia has a water gun to attack its predator .</p>
    <img src="images/130.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Diliptus : is the predator of peramissia </p>
    <img src="images/131.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Leaves have small holes called stomata , it takes carbon dioxide in and gives out oxygen .</p>
    <img src="images/132.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Trees and live without us ,but we can-not live without trees .</p>
    <p>Trees make food in sun light ,we cannot</p>
    <p>Let's see how they do it .</p>
    <p>Chlorophyll is a pigment that gives plants their green color, and it helps plants create their own food through photosynthesis.</p>
    <img src="images/133.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Photosynthesis</p>
    <img src="images/134.jpg" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>if we get the secret of making chloroplast ,it will be another revolution . </p>
    <br>
    <p>This chloroplast uses sun's energy to break water into hydrogen and oxygen atoms .  and releases oxygen moleclue as the waste product .</p>
    <img src="images/135.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>

    <p>This is atomic scale assembly line : Most important part of moleculer industrial complex . </p>
    <img src="images/136.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Sugar is made by combining carbon and oxygen </p>
    <img src="images/137.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Plants also works as a battery to store energy ,they store energy in the form of sugar .</p>
    <p>Because of this solar battery : farms ,forest ,plankten in oceans , humans and animals are alive</p>
    <p>We can do photosynthesis in lab but as good as plants do  </p>
    <img src="images/138.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Photosynthesis can provide for all of our energy demans</p>
    <p>We can reduce greenhouse by large scale photosynthesis</p>
    <img src="images/139.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Tardigrades can live without water for years , can live in space , oceans ,volcanos ,everywhere</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Orchid : was the first flower species on the earth ,also they have the highest variety . </p>
    <img src="images/140.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>fragrance : are the molecules cloud, either it is burned bread , flowers ,food or anything </p>
    <img src="images/141.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/142.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Whenever i inhale them , they activate a special type of receptor cells .which sends electrical signals to my brain ,which identifies what is this smell of exactly . </p>
    <img src="images/143.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/144.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">

    <p>Different smells brings molecules of different sizes . each smell ignites a different memeory</p>
    <img src="images/145.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>We are able to recognize the smell when the all factory nerves of our brain gets activated ,which is close to amegdela(this part of our brain is connected to our emotions .this is also close to hyppocampus) .</p>
    <img src="images/146.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Neurons that carry signals from nose to brain has evolved over lakhs of years , this is a self defence mechanism ,which alerts us from danger .</p>
    <p>If an animal recognizes fire through smell before getting stuck into it , will be able to pass its genes to next generations .</p>
    <img src="images/147.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Everytime we brethe we inhale atleast 10 cr molecules , when we exhale these molecule they get passed to everywhere and other organisms uses it .</p>
    <hr>
    <p>DIFFERENT MINERALS ARE JUST DIFFERERNT ATOMIC STRUCTURES </p>
    <img src="images/148.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <P>Carbon atom : started the life on earth :  </P>
    <p>Carbon is special because at a time is can connect to 4 types of different or same atoms ,carbon makes complex molecules</p>
    <img src="images/149.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/150.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Molecules made up of carbon is called protein ,protein are essential for life .</p>
    <img src="images/151.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Every living thing on earth is made up of carbon atoms . this is the difference between rocks and living things .</p>
    <img src="images/152.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>normally we don not touch each other , whenever we try to come close electron of one person repels the electrons of other person</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/153.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Electrons surrounded a nuclei makes a force field ,that acts as shock absorber .</p>
    <p>Normally nuclie of two atoms never touch each other ,we just feel that they are touching each other .</p>
    <img src="images/154.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Nucleus is very small compared to an atom . if atom is of the size of the church ,then nucleus will be the size of a sand  particle . most of the part of the atoms is empty</p>
    <img src="images/155.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Lets go the nucleus of the atom , most abundand element is hydrogen .1Proton 1 Electron </p>
    <img src="images/156.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Particle of the neucleus repel each other ,strong nuclear force binds them together </p>
    <img src="images/157.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Gold has 79 electrons , light falling in the gold me it glow so much . </p>
    <img src="images/158.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/159.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>There is a limit to how many neutrons can be there in a atom ,after that it becames unstable .</p>
    <p>Sun is a place where neucleus touch each other, sun appears solid but it is not ,sun is so hot that all of its atoms are in gaseous form </p>
    <img src="images/160.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Sun is so hot because due to gravity all of its atoms came very very close , they move very fast thus too much heat .</p>
    <img src="images/161.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>At sun even the nucleus touches each other , sun is a nucleus fusion reactor ,because of its gravity.</p>
    <img src="images/162.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>At sun hydrogen combines to form helium ,and nuclear energy is released in the form of photons .</p>
    <p>Helium is sun's nucleus ash </p>
    <p>Sun is a medium size start , its core's temperature is just 1cr degrees .</p>
    <p>Many stars are hotter then this ,because they are large and they have greater gravity .in these starts due to combining of helium heavier elemets like carbon and oxygen is formed</p>
    <p>after these stars become old these elements gets mixed in space .</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many stars bigger then this becomes supernova , in every 100 years 1 star becomes supernova  </p>
    <img src="images/163.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Supernova have so much temperature compared to sun's core that elememnts like iron becomes much heavier and gets thrown into space</p>
    <img src="images/164.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Neutrino can cross 100 light years steel wall , without being slowed . neutino rarely stikes with a substance .</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/165.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Feel the heat on your face , the energy that is giving you heat (protons) has started its journey 1 cr years ago , </p>
