    <h3><b>Each dot star in the sky is as bright and big as our sun , imagine how far our sun should be to look like a dot .</b></h3>
    <img src="images/66.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">   
    <p>Some star's ligh takes years,decades,centuries to reach earth</p>
    <p>Some star's light take so much time that , when they reach to us ,the star itself is dead ,but we are seeing it's past , a <b>GHOST</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>William Herschel [ 1738-1822 ] : was the first person to understand that telescope is a time machine ,without going to the past we cannot see anything in the space .</p>
    <p><b>In 1 sec : Light travels 3 Lakh km (same as distance between earth and moon , moon is 1 light second far away)</b></p>
    <p>Whenever we look at moon , think that we are looking at 1 second past . </p>
    <br>
    <p>Sun Rise is also a mirage , earth's atmosphere bends sun's light ,just like lens or water glass .</p>
    <img src="images/67.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">   
    <p>In 8 minutes , sun's light reach to earth ,sun is 8 light minutes far away from us ,from earth sun look like it was 8 minutes ago </p>
    <br>
    <p>Sun never rises : its earth that rotates(and us along with it (currently we are moving faster then a jet plane ))</p>
    <img src="images/68.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">  
    <br>
    <p>Horizon (the line at which the earth's surface and the sky appear to meet) is also a mirage</p>
    <img src="images/69.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%"> 

    <p>Planets rotate aroung sun ,thus distance between earth and farthest planet(neptune changes ) [light travesls this distance in 4 hrs] we are always seeing 4 light hours old neptune </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>1 Light Year = 10 Trillion KM</b></p>
    <p>Vyoger 1 travells at 56K kmpr</p>
    <img src="images/70.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%"> 
    <br>
    <p>Crab Nebula : is 6.5 light years far away from earth</p>
    <img src="images/71.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%"> 

    <p>JOKE : some people believe that universe is 6.5 K light years old ,but if that was to be true then how we are seeing light of starts farther away from crab nebula .</p>
    <p>The center of our galaxy is 30K light year farther away from earth </p>
    <p>There is no evidence of anything before the big bang </p>
    <p>from whereever we look at the universe , we appear to be at the center of the universe ,but it is just a mirage , it is no center of the universe and no end .</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>After few crore years after the big bang ,galaxy , stars are formed from clouds of hydrogen and helium , these new sources of light made the universe less dark , due to continous expanding of the universe ,development of the cosmos was even at the larger scale . Stars after dying left the heavier elements in the space , from that planets were formed .<b>COOL</b> ,and then life too happened</p>
    <p>During big bang matter and energy was made ,not only that space and time was also made,also the forces that bind together matter(including gravity ) </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Netwon explained gravity , after that William Herschel found that gravity does a whole lot [it applies the same at the most farthest of the galaxies] .</p>
    <br>
    <p>Newton was puzzled that how gavity affects planets without touching them , he called it action at a distance</p>
    <img src="images/72.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Michael Faraday[1791-1867] : found that everywhere there is invisible fields of force working ,through which we can understand gravity .</p>
    <img src="images/74.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/73.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Gravity and apple does not touch each other , fields between then touch each other </p>
    <p>He believed that everything with mass ,is spreading mass everywhere [THIS WAS THE ANSWER NEWTON WAS UNABLE TO FIND] </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>James Clerk Maxwell [1831-1879] : turned faraday's thoughts into mathematical laws</p>
    <img src="images/75.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>He found that these fields travells in space in the form of waves ,he found that these waves travells at the speed of light</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>While thinking about these problems Albert Einstein[1879-1955] kepts the photos of these 3 giants in front of him .</p>
    <img src="images/76.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>He was thinking about the speed of light , when we measure speed of something we compare it someone who is not moving .</p>
    <p>Problem is that : in cosmos everything is moving </p>
    <p>Imagine i am travelling at a speed of 10 kmpr wrt to earth ,,but earth itself is spinning at a speed of 1600 kmpr , earth is moving aroung sun at around 1 lakh km pr hour</p>
    <p>Sun itself is moving at a speed of 7 lakh km pr hour ,around galaxy .</p>
    <p>Galaxy itself is moving at a speed of 25 lakh km pr hour ? </p>
    <img src="images/77.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Nothing is stationary in cosmos ,everything is moving .</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Einstein thought what will happen if we travel at the speed of light .</p>
    <img src="images/78.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>There are some rules that are essential to follow ,while travelling at the speed of light .{Einstein called these principles of relitivity}</p>
    <p>Speed of light will not gets affected whether it is emmited from a moving or stationary body .</p>
    <p>Emitted light from the headlight of a moving bike will not be faster then the speed of light , light travells at constant speed irrespective of its source's speed</p>
    <img src="images/79.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Nothing can travel equal or greater then the speed of light , we can reach 99.9 % speed of light but not 100 perecent.</p>
    <p>light is 10 lakh times faster then the sound</p>
    <br>
    <p>Laws of physics can't be broken .job of the physicist is to find these laws .</p>
    <br>
    <p>WHEN WE TRAVELL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT LOT OF COOL THINGS HAPPEN : </p>
    <p>In a way travelling at the speed of light is like becoming immortal : then your biological clock becomes slow compared to the people that we left behind .</p>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <p>Dark star a.k.a Black : one way to find them is ,if there a nearby bright star , then this might be moving around the black hole . due to its huge gravitational pull.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Einstein : showed that space and expand and shrink a lot .</p>
    <p>Now gravity of earth is 1 g force</p>
    <p>if we removed gravity from one street</p>
    <img src="images/80.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/81.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/82.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>if we make gravity to 8g force: this is same gravity that a jet pilot experienced while turning the plance </p>
    <img src="images/83.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>at 1 lakh g force: fire hydrant will get crumbled by its own weight</p>
    <img src="images/84.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>At few lakh g force,gravity even attracts light ,light is still travelling at light speed ,but now it cannot escape gravity ,this is black whole ,or dark star</p>
    <img src="images/85.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When nuclear fuel of big star finishes ,then they were unable to stay hot enough to stop their internal gravity . the star shinks and shrinks until it became a black whole .</p>
    <br>
    <p>In X ray light : clouds near black-whole were so bright at 10 cr degree temperature</p>
    <img src="images/86.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>If you stay alive after entering a blackwhole ,they you might reappear in space at a different space and time </p>
    <p>when space changes ,expands or shriks ,time also changes with it .</p>
    <p>Einstein found that space and time are the two faces of the same coin [SPACE - TIME].</p>
    <p>[SPACE - TIME] can itself change so much that ,it can carry you anywhere at anyspeed .</p>
    <p>maybe blackwholes are the tunnels of universe .</p>
    <p>[SPACE - TIME]'s another magic ,there can be another universe inside a black whole , yet a blackwhole is a part of the universe . blackwhole's gravity can fit an entire universe's space inside it </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>We know that the gravity inside a dying star is so great , it is like that at the time of big bang .</p>
    <p>Also , universe inside a blackhole can also have a blackwhole,from which other universes can be made</p>
    <img src="images/87.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Maybe this is how our cosmos is made </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>John Herschel[1792-1871] : gave the word photography</p>
    <img src="images/88.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>photography literally means going back in time ,light protects an image through time </p>
    <br>
    <p>Maybe in future we can store 3D version of thoughts .</p>
