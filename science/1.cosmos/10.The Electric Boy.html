    <h3>How do you hear and see me , even if i am 1000's of KM far away .</h3>

    <br>
    <p>Earlier fast speed meaning , fast horses and fast ships . </p>
    <p>Our messages without being visible travel at light speed .HOW DO WE GET THIS POWER , ITS AN EFFORT OF A SINGLE MEN (FARADY)</p>
    <hr>
    <p>If FARADY did not existed , then world would not be having below</p>

    <hr>
    <p>there is an army of slaves that wait for our signals , how we made electrons work for us .</p>
    <p>This story starts with newton , he asked "how sun makes these planets revolve  without touching them . how does apple know where to fall ."</p>
    <p>Same problem also troubled einstein</p>
    <img src="images/193.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Between einstein and newton another genius was born FARADY , because of farady's work einstein gone that far</p>
    <br>
    <p>Farady : he made invisible army of electron dance at human will .</p>
    <p>This was the first motor of the world , that turned electricity to continous running mechanical motion .</p>
    <img src="images/194.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>THis invention changed everything</p>
    <img src="images/195.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">

    <br>
    <p>THINK ABOUT IT : TODAY : every business ,factory ,technology</p>
    <img src="images/198.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Everything that is persent today</p>
    <img src="images/199.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Is there because of FARADY's motor's experiment</p>
    <img src="images/194.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <br>
    <p>Humphy davy assigned farady to crack the method of making of good lenses</p>
    <p>After 4 years of intense hardwork , farady was not able to match fronhoffer's lens .</p>
    <img src="images/200.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>After humphy's death he came back</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Motion is getting converted into current ..THIS IS THE FIRST GENERATOR OF THE WORLD</p>
    <img src="images/201.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Faraday though around magent the space is filled with an invisible force lines .he named it field</p>
    <img src="images/202.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Magnet is not just magnetised iron rod </p>
    <img src="images/203.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/204.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/205.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/206.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Faraday believed all natural forces are one </p>
    <p>FARADY FOUND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAGNET AND ELECTRICITY : HE THOUGHT IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE 2 AND LIGHT</p>
    <hr>
    <p>For that he designed an expereiment</p>
    <img src="images/208.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">

    <p>He know that light moves like a wave , these waves move forward in all directions</p>
    <p>but there is a way to seperate wave : its called polarization </p>
    <img src="images/207.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/209.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>He wanted to know that magnetic field has any impact of light wave</p>
    <img src="images/210.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>A barrier to light wave , it can only pass if magnetic field is changing its path </p>
    <img src="images/211.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>He found that electromagnetic force can bend light </p>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/212.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>After he found that magnetic field can impact light , now he wanted to know how these three forces work together</p>
    <img src="images/213.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>He knew electric current can turn any wire into a magnet</p>
    <p>current passing through electric wire must be forming an magnetic field</p>
    <img src="images/214.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/215.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Earth is itself a magent </p>
    <img src="images/216.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>birld are the decendents of the kids of the dinasaurs</p>
    <img src="images/217.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>All birds are experts in finding there way , THERE IS A COMPUS IN BIRDS'S BODY ,thus they know about the magenetic field of the earth ,THERE BRAIN PROCESS MAGNETIC DATA JUST LIKE WE PROCESS VISUAL DATA .</p>
    <img src="images/218.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <P>WE ARE USING MAGNETIC FIELDS(through birds) FOR SO LONG AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF IT </P>
    <hr>
    <p>Why there is a magenetic field on earth and how it is made ,</p>
    <img src="images/219.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>when earth moves , its liquid iron near its core also moves ,that acts as a wire carrying current</p>
    <img src="images/220.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>as farady tought us electric field makes magnetic fields </p>
    <img src="images/221.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>This magnetic field also protect us from cosmic light , cosmic rays can pass through our dna </p>
    <img src="images/222.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Michale farady solved a problem that isac newton was unable to solve</p>
    <p>Without touching how sun makes other planet move in a particular way .</p>
    <img src="images/223.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Sun touches planets through its gravitational fields </p>
    <br>
    <p>Earth gravitational field tells apple how to fall</p>
    <img src="images/224.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <p>Farady was not good at maths , and world believed in his capabilites but never believed in his invisible force lines ideas , they wanted to see a mathematical formulae .</p>
    <p>James clarke maxwell who was good at maths ,gave him the formulaes</p>
    <img src="images/225.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <img src="images/226.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%">
    <hr>
    <p>Through equations we can see , and prove that this pendulam will not hit my face</p>
    <img src="images/227.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <hr>
    <p>When maxwell converted farady's ideas into equations he found the similarity</p>
    <img src="images/228.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <p>In the below equation , to balance it maxwell added a term ,after adding this term the stationary waves starts travelling at speed of light</p>
    <img src="images/229.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <hr>
    <p>And very soon ,through these waves ,we found ways to transmitting messages .</p>
    <img src="images/230.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <img src="images/231.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <p>SEEING</p>
    <img src="images/232.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <img src="images/233.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <img src="images/234.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <p>This changed the civilization , it turned hugely isolated world into a big village .</p>
    <img src="images/235.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >
    <p>We got connected with the speed of light</p>
    <img src="images/236.png" alt="image" height="30%" width="50%" >

    <p>FARADY : there is no magic that cannot be understood,provided it is following laws of nature</p>
