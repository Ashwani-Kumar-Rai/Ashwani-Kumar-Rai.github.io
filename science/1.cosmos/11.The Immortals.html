    <p>Radio waves travelling at light speed took almost 1 second to reach to the moon .</p>

    <p>Some radio waves got back after reflection , after 2.5 second radio waves done the round trip</p>

    <p>Since 1960 we are listening radio waves comming from the space , but that does not carry any recognizational message</p>

    <p>WAYS A CIVILIZATION CAN BE DESTROYED</p>
    <p>NEARBY SUPERNOVA :'s radiation Would have easily  destroyed our ozone layer</p>
    <p>VOLCANIC WINDER : destroying atomsphere</p>
    <p>ASTEROID : striking our earth surface</p>
