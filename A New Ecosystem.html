    <title>A New Ecosystem</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>A new ecosystem : Zombies , Humans and AI</h1>        
    <p>Last year and this one was particularly tough for me personally , family fi**t ,best friends b***e up , painfull dep******n , fear of loosing shitty j** ....you name it .</p>
    <P>All of this shit made me a fucking zombie , i was never a "bright kid " , and i can classify my old self as "near border zombie" , (after doing job for one year) i crossed the line !!! </P>
    <p><b>Current goal is to take a fucking U turn and run as fast as possible in human direction .</b></p>
    <p>But lets first define what i mean by zombie and human , thanks to chatGPT i don't have to explain ai (i am not so sure)</p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <p><u>My personal definitions </u></p>
    <p><b>Zombie</b>= (animals with human face) humans by physical appearance ,driven purely by primal instincts . </p>
    <p>you can put them through <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Gom_Jabbar" target="_blank">Gom Jabbar</a> and they will fail . </p>
    <p><u>Some symptoms of Zombies</u></p>
    <p>1. No critical thinking skills , they live on borrowed Knowledge { don't think things through their own head } , looking for opinions/suggestions of seniors / experts . </p>
    <p>2. No curiosity ,they ask one question and then goes silent , after an answer their mind goes shut . {they memorize the answers/suggestion/learning} </p>
    <p>3. Have single goal : survival {i.e money } , they do everything to look better to a company .{i.e trying to become an attractive prostitute (for better money) instead of skill . }</p>
    <p>4. Have no idea of what skill/engineering really is : zombies think that learning a new tools , programming languages is a skill . </p>
    <p>---> they can't think deep <u> zombie tech stack (application layer ) , i.e just make the thing work .</u></p>
    <p>---> they can go any layer deep <u> engineer tech stack : (application layer ,os,kernel , hardware , Von Neumann architecture , Turing machine , information theory , landauer limit ,Entropy) , and they know what will happen if technology changes at one particular layer </u></p>
    <p>5.useless or cheep philosophy : they entire philosophy can be summed up in (this is how it is , this will never change), we can't do much about it .</p>
    <p>6. its hard to differentiate(zombies and humans ) these days , because of fake confidence and personality ,,, but you asked 2-3 layers deep questions and you'll watch faces change .  </p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Human</b> their first priority if to remain human , despite survival challenges .(for them survival is 2nd priority ) . they have wide range of knowledge and skill . </p>
    <p>they can think of solutions that are structurally better (at-least they can think deep .)</p>
    <p><u> everything  is anti-Zombie</u></p> 
    <hr>   
    <p><b>AI</b> = GOD {this is the best definition i could come up with , coz its beyond human capacity} </p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <p>Earlier our ecosystem had only two player  1. zombies(above zombies and rest of animals combined ) and 2.Humans </p>
    <p>In that ecosystem zombies filled up the ranks of employees and humans filled up the ranks of engineers , if your job title says "Software Engineer" think hard what is engineering "you might be in delusion" .</p>
    <p>Add AI to think ecosystem , some people says AI can't do this or that , it does not matter ,they are wrong . </p>
    <p>I can rant on ai all day long ,its better to refer  <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2020/08/20/a-silicon-person.html" target="_blank">a-silicon-person</a></p>

    <p><u>My predictions for the future </u></p>
    <p><b>Short Answer :</b> if utopia -> Mass Wireheading  ,,, if dystopia -> ranges from (totalitarian to Human extinction) if you've read : "metamorphosis of prime intellect" ,the former is also Distopic</p>
    <p><b>Long Answer :</b> noboday knows , NOBODY !!! , so stop fucking asking about implications of ai to anybody (its self spaming) </p>
    <p>But few thing we know for sure : </p>
    <p>1. Humans will loose to ai , in almost all tasks . ie: the total number of jobs is heading towards ZERO over time .</p>
    <p>2. Humans will have god like technology , but most humans will be "uneducated : including degree holders" , their chimp brain will not be capable to comprehending  this new tech . </p>
    <p>3. Money will be useless in future , ai will be the provider of most goods and services , and AI humans will not have anything to offer to ai (thus money is useless) .if AI wil be in govt control then call it (UBI) , else i don't know (maybe slavery )</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Long Terms is still unclear , but we can see and plan short-turm</p>
    <p><u>Suggestions for short term : </u></p>
    <p><b>to aim for : </b></p>
    <p>1>Huge breadth of knowledge(across many many fields ) {is a hedge agains uncertainity} </p>
    <p>2> self reliant {from food to energy} , Buying or living in flat is a bad choice you just created more dependency .</p>
    <p>3.Transition to individualism (there is no hope in employee("sorry prostitutes ai is comming") way to living)</p>

    <p>I am depressed beyond expression , if i don't know you already and you are a human as per above definition , maybe we can do something together .</p>
