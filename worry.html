<h1> Worry === Unfinished Computation</h1>
<h5> 25  Apr  2023</h5>

<p> some people easily gets worried , even for the simplest of uncertainties</h4>
<p> They are THE EXPERTS in finding the slightest reasons to get worried [it&#39;s me] .</p>

<hr>

<h4> DEFINING : ( to say exactly what a word or idea means ) , certainly helps !!!</h4>
<p> let's try to define worry</p>
<h4><strong>WORRY : Constantly visiting an idea/though without getting a TRUE conclusion .</strong></h4>
<p><img src="/images/worry.png" alt="This is worry !"height="30%" width="50%"></p>
<h4> Worry is mostly Subconscious  or At best half processed thoughts . This is why it&#39;s so unproductive ,coz we are running in circles .</h4>

<hr>

<h3> Approach :</h3>
<ol>
<li>As soon as you starts feeling worry/Anxiety remind yourself that there are some unprocessed thoughts , and make it conscious .</li>
<li>Once you know that something is bothering you , try to define in as much detail as possible , include every (detail/possibility).</li>
<li>Put those details into three buckets :<ul>
<li>In my control</li>
<li>With effort can be in my control </li>
<li>can-never be in my control</li>
</ul>


<li>Act on first and second bucket and ignore the last bucket .</li>
</ol>
<p>after acting on these 4 steps for some time , either of 2 things will happen</p>
<ol>
<li>your assumption were correct , you actually solved the problem .[ MATTER CLOSED ] [ FINISHED COMPUTATION ] [ YOU WILL FEEL STRONG ]</li>
<li>your assumption were incorrect , you sidestepped actual problem.[ MATTER STILL OPEN ] [ VISIT STEPS AGAIN ] [ YOU WILL FEEL BETTER ]</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>People refer doining these steps as &quot;fighting&quot; and vice-versa . It better to fight then running in circles .</p>
<p>Coz , Sometimes these Subconscious junk can eat our decades .[as they took mine]</p>

<hr>
<p>"It reminds me of : Bene Gesserit Quote"</p>
<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</p>
