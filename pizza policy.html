    <p>i ordered an dominoz pizza , it was 47 min days i should have go it for free as per policy , i wanted that pizza for free it didn't argue with the delivery boy , but obviously  i wanted it for free .</p>
    <p>this thing happens at job : i had an option but i  didn't stood for myself meaning , but i should have . </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now i don't care much about whether i got the pizza free or not , coz it does not changes my life much.</p>
    <p>But this clearly shows a flaw in the way i approach in some situations .</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>PIZZA POLICY :</h3>
    <p>there can be three situations ...</p>
    <p><b>1.Things that will have virtually no impact on me :</b> leave it don't even bother . [LIKE PIZZA]</p>
    <p><b>2.Life impacting matters :</b>Just ho brutal with it , as if your life depends on it .[LIKE Kind of work at JOBl]</p>
    <p><b>3.Everything in middle :</b>refer [ time/gain ratio ] and [opportunity cost] </p>
